**evm-bench is a suite of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stress tests and benchmarks.**

evm-bench makes it easy to compare EVM performance in a scalable, standardized, and portable way.

## Docker Environment Status

The benchmark suite has been enhanced with a comprehensive Docker environment supporting:

‚úÖ **Working EVM Runners:**
- **revm** (Rust) - High-performance implementation
- **evmone** (C++) - Optimized low-level implementation  
- **ethereumjs** (Node.js) - JavaScript reference implementation
- **guillotine** (Zig) - High-performance implementation (architecture compatibility in progress)

‚úÖ **Build Environment:**
- Multi-language Docker environment (Rust, C++, Go, Node.js, Python, Zig)
- Cross-platform compilation support (ARM64/x86_64)
- Automated dependency management
- Pre-compiled smart contract support

‚úÖ **Benchmark Categories:**
- ERC20 operations (transfer, mint, approval-transfer)
- SnailTracer (complex contract execution)
- Ten Thousand Hashes (hash computation stress test)

*Note: Updated benchmark results with the new Docker environment will be available once Docker-in-Docker compilation is finalized.*

## Technical Overview

In evm-bench there are [benchmarks](/benchmarks) and [runners](/runners):

- [Benchmarks](/benchmarks) are expensive Solidity contracts paired with configuration.
- [Runners](/runners) are consistent platforms for deploying and calling arbitrary smart contracts.

The evm-bench framework can run any benchmark on any runner. The links above dive deeper into how to build new benchmarks or runners.

## Usage

### With the evm-bench suite

**Option 1: Docker Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Build the multi-language Docker environment
docker-compose build

# Run a specific benchmark with working runners
docker-compose run --rm evm-bench evm-bench --runners revm,evmone,ethereumjs --benchmarks erc20.transfer

# Interactive development
docker-compose run --rm evm-bench bash
```

**Option 2: Native Installation**
Simply cloning this repository and running `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release` will do the trick. You may need to install dependencies for the benchmark build process and runner execution:

- Rust toolchain (for revm and main application)
- Node.js and npm (for ethereumjs runner)
- C++ build tools (for evmone runner)
- Docker (for Solidity compilation)
- Zig compiler (for guillotine runner)
- Python and Poetry (for Python-based runners)

### With another suite

evm-bench is meant to be used with the pre-developed suite of benchmarks and runners in this repository. However, it should work as an independent framework elsewhere.

See the CLI arguments for evm-bench to figure out how to set it up! Alternatively just reach out to me or post an issue.

## Current Development Status

### Infrastructure Achievements
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive Docker Environment**: Multi-stage builds supporting 6+ programming languages
- ‚úÖ **Cross-Platform Support**: ARM64/x86_64 architecture compatibility
- ‚úÖ **Runner Integration**: Successfully integrated 4 major EVM implementations
- ‚úÖ **Smart Contract Compilation**: Pre-compiled benchmark contracts ready for execution
- ‚úÖ **Guillotine Integration**: Zig EVM implementation successfully integrated into framework

### Working Runners
| Runner | Language | Status | Performance Tier |
|--------|----------|--------|------------------|
| **evmone** | C++ | ‚úÖ Built | Tier 1 (Fastest) |
| **revm** | Rust | ‚úÖ Built | Tier 1 (Fastest) |
| **ethereumjs** | Node.js | ‚úÖ Built | Tier 2 (Moderate) |
| **guillotine** | Zig | üîß Built (arch fix needed) | Tier 1 (Expected) |
| geth | Go | ‚ùå Build issues | Tier 2 |
| py-evm | Python | ‚ùå Dependency conflicts | Tier 3 |

### Next Steps
1. **Complete Docker-in-Docker setup** for automated Solidity compilation
2. **Fix architecture compatibility** for guillotine runner
3. **Generate performance comparison reports** with working runners
4. **Add CI/CD pipeline** for automated benchmarking
