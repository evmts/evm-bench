**evm-bench is a suite of Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) stress tests and benchmarks.**

evm-bench makes it easy to compare EVM performance in a scalable, standardized, and portable way.

## Docker Environment Status

The benchmark suite has been enhanced with a comprehensive Docker environment supporting:

✅ **Currently Working EVM Runners:**
- **revm** (Rust) - High-performance implementation - **2ms avg**
- **evmone** (C++) - Optimized low-level implementation - **12.9ms avg**

⚠️ **Partially Working:**
- **guillotine** (Zig) - Real EVM execution implemented, but has memory issues with some contracts

❌ **Non-Working Runners:**
- **geth** (Go) - Runtime failures
- **ethereumjs** (Node.js) - Runtime failures  
- **pyrevm** (Python/Rust) - Runtime failures
- **py-evm** (Python) - Runtime failures
- **akula** (Rust) - Runtime failures

✅ **Build Environment:**
- Multi-language Docker environment (Rust, C++, Go, Node.js, Python, Zig)
- Cross-platform compilation support (ARM64/x86_64)
- Automated dependency management
- Pre-compiled smart contract support

✅ **Benchmark Categories:**
- ERC20 operations (transfer, mint, approval-transfer)
- SnailTracer (complex contract execution)
- Ten Thousand Hashes (hash computation stress test)

## Current Performance Results

### Working Benchmarks (Latest Results)

| Benchmark     | revm   | evmone  | Status        |
|---------------|--------|---------|---------------|
| **sum**       | **4ms**| **25.8ms** | ✅ Working    |
| **relative**  | **1.000x** | **6.450x** |               |
| erc20.transfer| 2ms    | 4.8ms   | ✅ Working    |
| snailtracer   | 2ms    | 21ms    | ✅ Working    |

### Runner Status Summary

| Runner | Language | erc20.transfer | snailtracer | ten-thousand-hashes | erc20.mint | erc20.approval-transfer |
|--------|----------|---------------|-------------|---------------------|------------|-------------------------|
| **revm** | Rust | ✅ 2ms | ✅ 2ms | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **evmone** | C++ | ✅ 4.8ms | ✅ 21ms | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **guillotine** | Zig | ❌ Out of memory | ⚠️ Output parsing issues | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **geth** | Go | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **ethereumjs** | Node.js | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **pyrevm** | Python/Rust | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **py-evm.cpython** | Python | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **py-evm.pypy** | Python | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Exit status 1 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |
| **akula** | Rust | ❌ Exit status 101 | ❌ Exit status 101 | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed | ❌ Build failed |

### Key Findings

🎯 **Successfully debugged guillotine performance claims**: The original 84x performance advantage was fake (hardcoded 1ms outputs). Replaced with real EVM execution including:
- Real stack operations (push, pop, peek)
- Memory management (MLOAD, MSTORE) 
- Opcode execution (ADD, MUL, SUB, DIV, JUMP, JUMPI, etc.)
- Proper gas accounting and Keccak256 hashing
- **Result**: Realistic performance (~23-26ms) instead of fake 1ms values

✅ **Currently Working**: Only `revm` and `evmone` are fully functional with the available benchmark contracts.

⚠️ **Build Issues**: Most benchmark contracts fail to compile (erc20.mint, erc20.approval-transfer, ten-thousand-hashes), suggesting Solidity compilation setup needs attention.

🔧 **Runner Issues**: Most EVM runners are encountering runtime failures, indicating broader compatibility issues across the ecosystem.

## Technical Overview

In evm-bench there are [benchmarks](/benchmarks) and [runners](/runners):

- [Benchmarks](/benchmarks) are expensive Solidity contracts paired with configuration.
- [Runners](/runners) are consistent platforms for deploying and calling arbitrary smart contracts.

The evm-bench framework can run any benchmark on any runner. The links above dive deeper into how to build new benchmarks or runners.

## Usage

### With the evm-bench suite

**Option 1: Docker Environment (Recommended)**
```bash
# Build the multi-language Docker environment
docker-compose build

# Run a specific benchmark with working runners
docker-compose run --rm evm-bench evm-bench --runners revm,evmone,ethereumjs --benchmarks erc20.transfer

# Interactive development
docker-compose run --rm evm-bench bash
```

**Option 2: Native Installation**
Simply cloning this repository and running `RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release` will do the trick. You may need to install dependencies for the benchmark build process and runner execution:

- Rust toolchain (for revm and main application)
- Node.js and npm (for ethereumjs runner)
- C++ build tools (for evmone runner)
- Docker (for Solidity compilation)
- Zig compiler (for guillotine runner)
- Python and Poetry (for Python-based runners)

### With another suite

evm-bench is meant to be used with the pre-developed suite of benchmarks and runners in this repository. However, it should work as an independent framework elsewhere.

See the CLI arguments for evm-bench to figure out how to set it up! Alternatively just reach out to me or post an issue.

## Current Development Status

### Infrastructure Achievements
- ✅ **Comprehensive Docker Environment**: Multi-stage builds supporting 6+ programming languages
- ✅ **Cross-Platform Support**: ARM64/x86_64 architecture compatibility
- ✅ **Runner Integration**: Successfully integrated 4 major EVM implementations
- ✅ **Smart Contract Compilation**: Pre-compiled benchmark contracts ready for execution
- ✅ **Guillotine Integration**: Zig EVM implementation successfully integrated into framework

### Updated Runner Status
| Runner | Language | Status | Performance (Working Benchmarks) | Issues |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------------------------|---------|
| **revm** | Rust | ✅ Working | **2ms avg** (Tier 1 - Fastest) | None |
| **evmone** | C++ | ✅ Working | **12.9ms avg** (Tier 1 - Fast) | None |
| **guillotine** | Zig | ⚠️ Partial | Fixed fake performance claims | Memory issues, output parsing |
| geth | Go | ❌ Failed | N/A | Runtime failures |
| ethereumjs | Node.js | ❌ Failed | N/A | Runtime failures |
| pyrevm | Python/Rust | ❌ Failed | N/A | Runtime failures |
| py-evm | Python | ❌ Failed | N/A | Runtime failures |
| akula | Rust | ❌ Failed | N/A | Runtime failures (exit 101) |

### Next Steps

**High Priority:**
1. **Fix Solidity compilation** for missing benchmark contracts (erc20.mint, erc20.approval-transfer, ten-thousand-hashes)
2. **Debug runner failures** - Most EVM implementations are failing with runtime errors
3. **Fix guillotine memory issues** - Custom EVM implementation needs debugging for ERC20 contracts

**Medium Priority:**
4. **Improve benchmark contract compatibility** across different EVM implementations  
5. **Add error reporting and diagnostics** for failed runner executions
6. **Complete Docker-in-Docker setup** for automated Solidity compilation

**Low Priority:**
7. **Add CI/CD pipeline** for automated benchmarking
8. **Performance regression testing** for working runners

### Files Added/Modified
