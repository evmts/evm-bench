# EVM Benchmark Implementation Status

## Summary
Fixed fake performance results in multiple EVM runners to ensure they use actual EVM implementations.

## Runner Status

### ✅ REVM (Rust)
- **Status**: Working correctly with actual REVM v27.0.3 library
- **Performance**: ~56ms for snailtracer
- **Key Fix**: Increased gas limit from 10M to 1B (snailtracer needs 236M gas)
- **File**: `runners/revm/src/main.rs`

### ✅ Geth (Go) 
- **Status**: Working correctly with go-ethereum library
- **Performance**: ~172ms for snailtracer
- **Key Fix**: Built with CGO_ENABLED=0 to avoid macOS linking issues
- **File**: `runners/geth/runner.go`

### ⚠️ evmone (C++)
- **Status**: Using actual evmone library but has execution issues
- **Performance**: Shows 0 gas usage - contract not executing properly
- **Issue**: MockedHost not properly handling contract execution
- **File**: `runners/evmone/runner.cpp`

### ❌ Guillotine (Zig)
- **Status**: Cannot import actual Guillotine EVM library
- **Issue**: Module import errors - can't find Guillotine module from dependency
- **File**: `runners/guillotine/src/main.zig`

## Key Findings

1. **Fake Results Removed**: Both Guillotine and REVM were outputting hardcoded fake timing values
2. **Gas Limit Critical**: Snailtracer benchmark requires 236M gas to run properly
3. **Realistic Performance**: 
   - REVM: ~56ms
   - Geth: ~172ms
   - evmone: TBD (execution issues)
   
## Remaining Issues

1. evmone's MockedHost doesn't properly execute contract calls (shows 0 gas usage)
2. Guillotine can't import its EVM library module from the dependency
3. Need to verify all benchmarks work on all runners
