# Guillotine EVM Runner Implementation Status

## What Was Done

### 1. Project Structure Setup
- Created `/runners/guillotine/` directory following evm-bench conventions
- Set up Zig build system with `build.zig` and `build.zig.zon`
- Added Guillotine as a dependency using `zig fetch --save https://github.com/evmts/Guillotine/archive/main.tar.gz`
- Created runner configuration files:
  - `runner.evm-bench.json` - Defines the runner metadata
  - `entry.sh` - Shell script entry point that builds and executes the runner
  - Made entry script executable

### 2. Runner Implementation
- Implemented `src/main.zig` with the required evm-bench runner interface:
  - Command-line argument parsing for `--contract-code-path`, `--calldata`, `--num-runs`
  - Hex decoding utilities for contract bytecode and calldata
  - File reading utilities for contract code
  - Placeholder timing output (as required by evm-bench spec)

### 3. Integration Attempts
- Successfully built the Zig runner executable
- Configured build system to create optimized release builds
- Attempted to integrate with the main evm-bench framework

## Current Issues

### 1. Module Import Problem (Resolved)
**Issue**: Initially tried to import Guillotine as `@import("guillotine")` but the module name was incorrect.
**Resolution**: Commented out the import and created a placeholder implementation for now.

### 2. Segmentation Fault in Runner
**Issue**: The runner executable crashes with "Segmentation fault: 11" when executed.
**Details**: 
```bash
$ ./entry.sh --contract-code-path /dev/null --calldata "" --num-runs 1
./entry.sh: line 7: 77294 Segmentation fault: 11  $SCRIPT_DIR/zig-out/bin/guillotine-runner "$@"
```
**Likely Cause**: The current implementation uses placeholder code and may have memory management issues in the argument parsing or file reading logic.

### 3. Main evm-bench Build Issues
**Issue**: The main evm-bench Rust project has compilation issues on macOS.
**Details**: 
- Initial time crate version incompatibility (resolved with `cargo update`)
- SystemConfiguration framework linking error: `ld: framework 'SystemConfiguration' not found`
**Impact**: Cannot test the full integration until the main build system is fixed.

### 4. Guillotine Integration Gap
**Issue**: The current implementation is a placeholder that doesn't actually use the Guillotine EVM.
**Details**: 
- Need to understand Guillotine's module structure and API
- Need to implement actual EVM execution with timing measurements
- Current code just outputs dummy timing values

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate (To Fix Segfault)
1. Debug the segmentation fault:
   - Add better error handling in argument parsing
   - Test with valid contract code files instead of `/dev/null`
   - Add debug logging to isolate the crash location

### Short Term (Placeholder to Real Implementation)
1. Investigate Guillotine's actual module structure:
   - Examine the downloaded dependency files
   - Find the correct import path and API
   - Study Guillotine's benchmark examples in `bench/**/*.zig`

2. Implement real EVM execution:
   - Replace placeholder timing with actual Guillotine EVM calls
   - Ensure contract deployment and execution work correctly
   - Measure only the EVM interpreter loop (as per evm-bench requirements)

### Medium Term (Full Integration)
1. Fix main evm-bench build issues on macOS
2. Add Zig executable validation to the main Rust binary
3. Test full integration with actual benchmarks

## File Structure Created
```

```

## Test Commands Used
```bash
# Build the runner
cd /Users/williamcory/evm-bench/runners/guillotine
zig build

# Test the runner directly (crashes with segfault)
./entry.sh --contract-code-path /dev/null --calldata "" --num-runs 1

# Attempt full evm-bench integration (build issues)
cd /Users/williamcory/evm-bench
RUST_LOG=info cargo run --release -- --runners guillotine --benchmarks ten-thousand-hashes
```

## Conclusion
The basic infrastructure for the Guillotine EVM runner has been established following evm-bench conventions, but the implementation currently has critical runtime issues that prevent it from functioning. The segmentation fault needs to be resolved before proceeding with actual Guillotine EVM integration.
